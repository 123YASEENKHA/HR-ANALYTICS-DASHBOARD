HR Analytics Dashboard Project using Tableau
Overview
Welcome to the HR Analytics Dashboard project, where I showcase my skills in designing and developing a dynamic HR analytics dashboard using Tableau. This project aims to provide valuable insights for HR departments by visualizing key metrics such as head count, attrition, department-wise analysis, age distribution, and gender insights.

Project Highlights
Dynamic Dashboard: The dashboard is interactive, featuring action filters for detailed data analysis. Users can explore department-wise data, track attrition, and gain valuable HR insights.
Insightful Visualizations: Utilizing various Tableau features, I've created KPI cards, lollipop charts, dual-axis charts, and a department-wise attrition pie chart to present data in a visually appealing manner.
Data Analysis Fundamentals: The project emphasizes the importance of studying and understanding the data before dashboard design. I discuss metadata, sample data, and the critical process of creating calculated fields, such as attrition and average age calculations.

Project Structure

Understanding Data: A crucial step in the project, I explain the importance of studying data before designing the dashboard, covering metadata and sample data.
Calculations: I walk through the creation of attrition calculation fields, active employee calculations, and average age calculations.
Design and Layout: The video details the design process, including creating KPI cards, dual-axis charts, and custom backgrounds for a visually appealing dashboard.
Formatting: I demonstrate how to format the dashboard for visual appeal, adjusting elements like font, text alignment, and overall dashboard appearance.
Part 2: Department-wise Attrition Pie Chart
Pie Chart Design: I guide you through the process of designing a pie chart to visualize department-wise attrition, using color dimensions and percentage labels.
Legends and Formatting: Learn how to format legends, increase pie chart size, and adjust font size for a polished look.
Frequency Chart: The video covers the creation of a frequency chart, including binning age data and adjusting bin size using parameters.
